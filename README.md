SUPERMART ANALYSIS

This project demonstrates the use of SQL for data analysis and manipulation within a PostgreSQL database. Key objectives included data exploration, aggregation, and advanced querying techniques to extract meaningful insights. The tasks were designed to handle real-world scenarios, focusing on sales, customer behavior, and profitability.
1.Data Aggregation and Analysis:
Calculated total, average, and percentage-based metrics for sales and profit across various dimensions like region, segment, and product.

2.Window Functions:
Implemented ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK() to rank sales and customers based on performance.
Used SUM() and AVG() window functions for running totals and moving averages.

3.Conditional Analysis:
Evaluated the impact of discounts on profitability and identified trends by grouping and filtering data.

4.String Manipulation:
Extracted and formatted specific parts of text data using functions like SUBSTRING() and LIKE.

5.Advanced Queries:
Utilized complex subqueries, CTEs, and JOIN operations to merge and analyze data from multiple tables (e.g., linking sales data with customer and product information).

6.Data Type Management:
Converted data types for numerical precision, ensuring consistency in calculations (e.g., converting DOUBLE PRECISION to NUMERIC).

7.Performance Optimization:
Grouped data and applied filters using GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY for efficient query execution.
